Please help me break down the method into multiple slices.
The target method is provided with line numbers.

Here are the basic details about the method
```json
{{ focal method }}
```
```json
{{ dependencies }}
```

Please decompose the method under test following the instructions:

1. Summarise the focal method
2. List necessary env settings to run the focal method
   - Invoked parameters and fields
   - Invoked methods
3. Decompose the focal method into multiple problem-solving steps
   3.1 describe the subtask of the slice
   3.2 replicate the corresponding code statements
   3.3 identify the start and end line numbers of the slice

Please output following the format: Please first provide the analysis for Step 1 and Step 2 in Markdown format. Then, output the decomposition results (Step 3) strictly in the following JSON format:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "description": "<The subtask description of slice 1 in natural language>",
    "code": "<The replicated code statements of slice 1, keeping original indentation>",
    "start_line": <The start line number>,
    "end_line": <The end line number>
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "description": "<The subtask description of slice 2>",
    "code": "<The replicated code statements of slice 2>",
    "start_line": <The start line number>,
    "end_line": <The end line number>
  }
  // ... more slices if necessary
]
```
