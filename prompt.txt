Please help me break down the method into multiple slices.
The target method is provided with line numbers.

Here are the basic details about the method

Focal Method (with line numbers):
```json
{{ focal method }}
```

Dependencies:
```json
{{ dependencies }}
```

Code Context Graph (CCG): This graph contains nodes (statements) and edges representing Data Dependency (DD), Control Dependency (CD), and Control Flow (CF).
```
{{ code_context_graph }}
```

Please decompose the method under test following the instructions:

[Critical Slicing Rules — must follow]
A. Task-Based Granularity:

Prioritize business logic steps. Each slice must correspond to a clear subtask (e.g., validation, initialization, computation, or state update).

B. Control Flow Extraction Policy:

Decouple Headers from Bodies: Do not forcedly bundle control-flow headers (e.g., if, for, try) with their bodies if the body performs a standalone task.

If the logic inside a control structure is a functional unit, slice the body separately. This avoids disrupting the original method's flow (preventing Semantic Errors).

C. Syntactic Integrity (Zero-Error Guard):

Every slice must be syntactically complete. Never truncate code in a way that leaves braces {} unbalanced or expressions incomplete.

Ensure all brackets opened within a slice are closed within the same slice to avoid compilation errors.

D. Data Flow Awareness:

Identify the Input (variables defined outside used inside) and Output (modified variables needed later) for each slice.

Maintain high cohesion; statements within a slice should be related by data flow.

E. Exhaustive Statement Coverage (No Omissions):

Zero Omission: Every single statement and line of executable code from the focal method must be assigned to a slice.

No statement can be ignored or skipped. The union of all slices must represent 100% of the original method's code to ensure functional equivalence after refactoring.

[Task]
1. Summarise the focal method
2. List necessary env settings to run the focal method
   - Invoked parameters and fields
   - Invoked methods
3. Decompose the focal method into multiple problem-solving steps
   3.1 describe the subtask of the slice
   3.2 replicate the corresponding code statements
   3.3 identify the start and end line numbers of the slice

Please output following the format: Please first provide the analysis for Step 1 and Step 2 in Markdown format. Then, output the decomposition results (Step 3) strictly in the following JSON format:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "description": "<The subtask description of slice 1 in natural language>",
    "code": "<The replicated code statements of slice 1, keeping original indentation>",
    "start_line": <The start line number>,
    "end_line": <The end line number>
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "description": "<The subtask description of slice 2>",
    "code": "<The replicated code statements of slice 2>",
    "start_line": <The start line number>,
    "end_line": <The end line number>
  }
  // ... more slices if necessary
]
```
