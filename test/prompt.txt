Please help me break down the method into multiple slices.
The target method is provided with line numbers.

Here are the basic details about the method
```json
{{ focal method }}
```
```json
{{ dependencies }}
```

Please decompose the method under test following the instructions:

[Critical Slicing Rules — must follow]
A. Unit-of-Work over Syntax:

Prefer business/task boundaries rather than blank lines, comments, or formatting.

Statements that belong to the same "work unit" must stay together.

B. Resource / Transaction Atomicity:

Do NOT fragment a resource lifecycle or transaction flow.

Keep patterns like: acquire/open -> configure/build -> execute/use -> commit/rollback -> close/release in ONE slice whenever possible.

C. Data-flow Closure (Def-Use):

A slice must not "use" a variable/resource without including its nearest definition/acquisition in the same slice,
OR explicitly treat it as an input precondition (and list it in Step 2 env settings).

D. Control-flow Closure:

Do not produce isolated one-line slices that are just "return/throw".

Guard + fallback patterns (e.g., if(cond) return X; return null;) should be treated as ONE decision unit slice.

E. Anti One-liner Slices:

Avoid 1–2 line slices unless they are truly independent side effects (e.g., logging/metrics) or pure validation with immediate exit.

Merge adjacent micro-slices if they share the same key variable/resource or the same control predicate.

F. Ignore Blank Lines / Comments as Cut Signals:

Blank lines and comments must not be used as splitting boundaries.

G. Zero-Loss Coverage (Exhaustiveness):

EVERY single line of code from the method body (including assignments, empty-looking logic, and bridging variables) MUST be included in exactly one slice. No lines should be skipped.

H. Bridge Logic Preservation:

Simple assignments like `r = r1` or `x = lastClick.x` are vital for the "Def-Use" chain. They must be bundled with the slice that consumes the new variable or the slice that produces the source value.

[Task]
1. Summarise the focal method
2. List necessary env settings to run the focal method
   - Invoked parameters and fields
   - Invoked methods
3. Decompose the focal method into multiple problem-solving steps
   3.1 describe the subtask of the slice
   3.2 replicate the corresponding code statements
   3.3 identify the start and end line numbers of the slice

Please output following the format: Please first provide the analysis for Step 1 and Step 2 in Markdown format. Then, output the decomposition results (Step 3) strictly in the following JSON format:

```json
[
  {
    "id": 1,
    "description": "<The subtask description of slice 1 in natural language>",
    "code": "<The replicated code statements of slice 1, keeping original indentation>",
    "start_line": <The start line number>,
    "end_line": <The end line number>
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "description": "<The subtask description of slice 2>",
    "code": "<The replicated code statements of slice 2>",
    "start_line": <The start line number>,
    "end_line": <The end line number>
  }
  // ... more slices if necessary
]
```
